MySQL Tutorial

1. DISTINCT Keyword

SELECT DISTINCT
    lastname
FROM
    employees
ORDER BY lastname;

2. ORDERBY

SELECT
 contactLastname,
 contactFirstname
FROM
 customers
ORDER BY
 contactLastname DESC;
 
 3. INNER JOIN - The MySQL INNER JOIN clause matches rows in one table with rows in other tables and allows you to query rows that contain columns 
 from both tables.
 
 SELECT 
    productCode, 
    productName, 
    textDescription
FROM
    products t1
        INNER JOIN
    productlines t2 ON t1.productline = t2.productline;
    
4. LEFT OUTER JOIN - When you join the t1 table to the t2 table using the LEFT JOIN clause, if a row from the left table t1 matches a row from the 
right table t2 based on the join condition ( t1.c1 = t2.c1 ), this row will be included in the result set.

In case the row in the left table does not match with the row in the right table, the row in the left table is also selected and combined with 
a “fake” row from the right table. The fake row contains NULL for all corresponding columns in the SELECT clause.

SELECT
 c.customerNumber,
 c.customerName,
 orderNumber,
 o.status
FROM
 customers c
LEFT JOIN orders o ON c.customerNumber = o.customerNumber;

5. Find the nth highest salary using the TOP keyword in SQL Server

SELECT TOP 1 Salary
FROM (
      SELECT DISTINCT TOP N Salary
      FROM Employee
      ORDER BY Salary DESC
      ) AS Emp
ORDER BY Salary

6. Find the nth highest salary using the LIMIT keyword

SELECT Salary FROM Employee ORDER BY Salary DESC LIMIT n-1,1
