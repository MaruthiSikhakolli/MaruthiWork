2. What is a test case?
Ans. A TEST CASE is a set of conditions or variables under which a tester will determine whether a system under test satisfies requirements or works correctly.

3. What is the main difference between Array and Array List?
Ans. Array will have fixed size once declared. Array size cannot be modified.
Array List will have dynamic size. It will change dynamically while more number of elements are added.

One more important diff is array can add both objects and primitives. But array list only adds objects. if you try to add primitives, it will convert them to objects and add to it.
